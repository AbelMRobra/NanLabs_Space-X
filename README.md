# NanLabs_Space-X
A bridge between Trello and the management ðŸš€

This is my solution for the <a href="https://doc.clickup.com/p/h/e12h-16043/f3e54f9ffd37f57">exercise</a>

For test the app you have to send a task for this <a href="https://abelmrobra.github.io/NanLabs_Space-X/">URL</a>

### How this app works?

- This app has a little template (thaks to Github for rendering it)
- You have to complete the form and send de information
- Your request is processed for a function in an endpoint builded with FastApi
- It's all!, Enjoy the bridge

## Warning
Heroku goes into idle state after a while, first check out the endpoint
